    <!-- 
     css  specificity
    in styling we have set margin-bottom to 0 in p
    
    but we are changing the values of margin-bottom in different classes
    the property in  .class is getting executed is becasue the .class have more priority than normal "p"
    
    the selector which is more specific have more priority
    here p targets all paragraphs on the page whereas .class selectors selects only specific paragraph in the page.
    
    
    
    to get spacing between the words in paragraph just create span and style that span class as required
    -->
